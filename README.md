# MVVM-Dagger2-RXJava-Sample-Project
Code assignment for kariyer.net android developer challenge

## Libraries Used

  * **Dagger2** :
    To remove dependencies between modules I used well-known DI library for android Dagger 2. With newer versions, it really made dependency management easy and understandable. 
    
  * **Retrofit** :
    This handy library saves our development times and makes development of networking parts easier and faster. Also developer friendly structure of this library makes it first choice for networking.
  
  * **RXAndroid** :
    It is an evolutionary tool to let us handle async operations in a better way. Also using retrofit with rxandroid and take benefit of using observables makes developers gain advantages on development phases
    
   * **Databinding** :
     Databinding library helped me to remove boilerplate codes from my project and gave me a chance to tie business logic and UI easily. 
     
## Design Pattern Used - MVVM

Because it provides clearer separation of the UI and application logic and it is commonly being used in these days by everyone , I wanted to write proect by using MVVM. This is architectural pattern that exist with dataBinding. Comparing to other popular patter MVP, in MVVM view not holding reference of presentation layer and vice versa.
